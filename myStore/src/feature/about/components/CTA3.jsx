            <p>
              We spend months finding the best factories around the worldâ€”the
              same ones that produce your favorite designer labels. We visit
              them often and build strong personal relationships with the
              owners. Each factory is given a compliance audit to evaluate
              factors like fair wages, reasonable hours, and environment. Our
              goal? A score of 90 or above for every factory.
